Youth Unemployment Solution with Rwanda Stock Exchange
Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between youth unemployment in Rwanda and the Rwanda Stock Exchange (RSE). By analyzing both datasets, the goal is to uncover insights that can help reduce youth unemployment, promote entrepreneurship through loans, and encourage investment through buying shares for future profit. A key feature of this project is the integration of a system where youth can access loans funded by investors, creating a sustainable cycle of economic empowerment.

Objective

Stock Market Influence: Investigate how RSE performance impacts job creation and youth employment opportunities.
Promote Entrepreneurship: Explore how loans can help youth start businesses and reduce unemployment.
Investment Strategies: Identify promising sectors on the RSE for youth investment through buying shares.
Loan Opportunities: Develop a framework where youth can leverage loans funded by investments to start businesses and create jobs.
Dataset Sources
Rwanda Stock Exchange Data: Stock prices, trading volumes, and market indicators from official sources like the RSE website.
Youth Unemployment Data: Statistics on youth unemployment, including demographics and education levels, from government reports (e.g., NISR).
